## ⚙️ Recommended Printer Settings

For best results, use these settings in your browser print dialog:

| Setting | Recommended Value | Why |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| **Printer** | Dymo LabelWriter 400 | Required for thermal printing |

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Label is too small or too large

**Cause**: Scale is not set to 100%

**Solution**:
1. Open print dialog
2. Look for "Scale" or "Fit to page" setting
3. Set to **100%** or **Actual size**
4. Print again

---

### Problem: QR code doesn't scan

**Cause**: Low print quality or dirty printer

**Solution**:
1. Clean printer head with alcohol wipe
2. Use high-quality thermal labels
3. Set print quality to "High" or "Best"
4. Ensure label is flat, not curled

---

### Problem: Text is cut off

**Cause**: Margins are added, or label misaligned

**Solution**:
1. Check label is properly loaded in printer
2. Adjust label guide for snug fit
3. In print dialog, set margins to "None"
4. Verify paper size is 25mm x 25mm

---

### Problem: Printer not found in dialog

**Cause**: Drivers not installed or printer not connected

**Solution**:
1. Check USB cable is plugged in securely
2. Verify printer is powered on (green light)
3. Reinstall Dymo LabelWriter drivers
4. Restart browser and try again

---

### Problem: Print dialog shows wrong paper size

**Cause**: Printer hasn't auto-detected label size

**Solution**:
1. Open/close printer cover to trigger detection
2. Print test label from Dymo software
3. In browser print dialog, select "Custom" size
4. Manually enter 25mm x 25mm

---

## 📱 Mobile Printing

### iOS (iPad/iPhone)

Mobile printing is **not recommended** for thermal labels. The Dymo 400 requires USB connection and specific drivers that aren't available on iOS.

**Alternative**: Use the desktop application, or manually write asset codes on labels.

### Android

Similar limitations - thermal printers typically require desktop drivers.

**Workaround**: Use remote desktop to access a computer with the Dymo 400 connected.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Print in Batches
If you need to print many labels, open multiple asset tabs and print them one after another. The printer will queue them automatically.

### Tip 2: Test Before Bulk Printing
Always print one test label before printing a large batch. Verify QR code scans correctly and all text is visible.

### Tip 3: Store Labels Properly
Keep unused thermal labels in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. Heat and light can darken thermal paper over time.

### Tip 4: Clean Printer Regularly
Wipe the printer head with isopropyl alcohol every 50-100 labels to maintain print quality.

### Tip 5: Use Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Print**: `Ctrl+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+P` (Mac)
- **Close Dialog**: `Esc` key
- **Navigate**: `Tab` to move between buttons

## 🎯 Label Placement Best Practices

### Where to Place Labels

**Recommended Locations**:
- ✅ **Laptops**: Bottom case, near serial number sticker
- ✅ **Desktops**: Front or top panel, visible when deployed
- ✅ **Monitors**: Back of monitor, near base
- ✅ **Peripherals**: Flat surface on underside
- ✅ **Mobile devices**: On protective case (not device itself)

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Surfaces that get hot (near vents, power supplies)
- ❌ Curved surfaces (QR codes may not scan well)
- ❌ Frequently touched areas (labels may wear quickly)
- ❌ Near liquids or food areas

### Durability Tips

1. **Clean Surface First**: Wipe with alcohol to remove dust/oils
2. **Apply Firmly**: Press label down for 10 seconds
3. **Avoid Stretching**: Place flat, don't pull or stretch
4. **Protect from Wear**: Consider clear laminate over label for high-use items
